<H1>Theranos</H1>

    <b>Theranos</b> (/ˈ<a href="">θɛrənoʊs</a>/) was an American <a href="">Privately Health Technology</a> Corporation. <a href=""><sup>[2]</sup></a> It was initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised blood tests that required only very small amounts of blood and could be performed very rapidly using small automated devices the company had developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false. <a href=""><sup>[3][4][5]</sup></a> Founded in 2003 by 19-year-old
    <a href="">Elizabeth Holmes,<sup>[6]</sup></a>Theranos raised more than <a href="">U$$</a>700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, <a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014.<a href=""><sup>[8][9]</sup></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    A turning point came in 2015 when medical research professors <a href="">John Ioannidis</a> and <a href="">Eleftherios</a> Diamandis, along with investigative journalist <a href="">John Carreyrou</a> of <a href="">The Wall Street Journal</a>, questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. The company faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the <a href="">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), <a href="">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. <a href=""><sup>[10]</sup></a> By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. <a href=""><sup>[11]</sup></a> The company was near <a href="">bankruptcy</a> until it received, in 2017, a $100 million loan from Fortress Investment Group secured by its patents. <a href=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its <a href="">CLIA</a> certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a laboratory for two years. <a href=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. <a href=""><sup>[14]</sup></a> In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS. <a href=""><sup>[15]</sup></a> Following the CMS sanctions, the <a href="">Walgreens</a> pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous <a href="">breaches of contract</a>. The suit was <a href="">settled out of court</a>, with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018. <a href=""><sup>[16]</sup>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
    On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president <a href="">Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani</a> were charged with "massive <a href="">fraud"</a> by the SEC. <a href=""><sup>[17]</sup></a> One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000. <a href=""><sup>[18]</sup></a> Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any <a href="">public company</a> for ten years. <a href=""><sup>[19]</sup></a> According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise <a href=""> liquidated</a>, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. <a href=""><sup>[7]</sup></a> Balwani did not settle. <a href=""><sup>[20]</sup></a> On June 15, 2018, the <a href="">U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California</a> announced the indictment of Holmes on <a href="">wire fraud</a> and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges. <a href=""><sup>[21]</sup></a> The trial was scheduled to commence in August 2020, <a href=""><sup>[22]</sup></a> but it has been delayed due to the <a href="">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and Holmes' pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021, <a href=""><sup>[23]</sup></a> while Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022. <a href=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>

    While at <a href="">Stanford University</a>, Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood. <a href=""><sup>[25]</sup></a> She started developing <a href="">lab-on-a-chip</a> technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers. <a href=""><sup>[26]</sup></a> Holmes dropped out of Stanford in 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words "therapy" and "diagnosis".[27][28] The company's original name was "Real-Time Cures", <a href=""><sup>[8][29][30]</sup></a> which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word "cure". <a href=""><sup>[8]</sup></a>
